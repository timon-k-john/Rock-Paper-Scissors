- This is one of my first websites I created while learning front end web development

- It is a simple Rock Paper Scissors game where the user plays against the computer

- The score is store in localStorage so as to save the previous score

- The computer generates a random number and depending on the value, it generates a move and checks it with the move played by the user

- Its a user friendly website which uses images as buttons to make it easier to play.
